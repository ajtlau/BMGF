The below charts the journey of three user-types through the [system diagram](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/Artifacts/System%20Diagram.jpg).

# Participant in the cash economy that wishes to engage in banking services
1. Participant has not received education about banking services that may be available to her or him, and does not apply for financial products.

3. Participant is sufficiently educated in relation to financial services, but is rejected on application for insufficient identification documentation.
4. Participant is sufficiently educated in relation to financial services, but is rejected on application for insufficient credit information.
5. Participant is sufficiently educated in relation to financial services, but is offered a disproportionately high interest rate as the financial service provider's credit algorithm is only able to consider traditional financial data.

7. Participant is sufficiently educated in relation to financial services, and is offered savings / loan services, but is offered risk reduction financial services at too high a price (because of insufficient data to properly analyse the participant from an actuarial perspective) and defaults (e.g. income / flood / disaster insurance).
